# Overview {.unnumbered}

AI is everywhere!

Some notable examples:

-   google lens ([region proposal network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497v3))
-   google translate ([Transformer-based](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03983))
-   YouTube automatic captioning ([automatic speech recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100))
-   Gmail spam filters (rule-based filters + Density clustering)
-   apple's faceID ([deep convolutional networks](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/face-detection))
-   Tesla autonomous car ([deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0z4FweCy4M))
-   virtual assistant (Siri, Google Assistant)
-   NVIDIA DLSS ([Deep learning supersampling](https://www.nvidia.com/en-my/geforce/technologies/dlss/))
-   Bloomberg ([NLP sentiment analysis](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/artificial-intelligence-ai/))

## Artificial intelligence, Machine learning and Deep learning

Data science and statistics - are two of the same, except that in earlier days, Data Science as we know it today, was called "statistical data analysis" or "applied statistics".

"Data Scientist" means a professional who uses scientific methods to liberate and create meaning from raw data.

"Statistics" means the practice or science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities.

There are no real difference between the two, except that "Data Scientists" prowes in large scale data or Big Data and fast computing. Otherwise, they are the same.

Today, there are no difference between the two.[@Donoho]

```{r venna, echo=FALSE , fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = " Figure 2: Everything everywhere all at once[@Ryan]"}
knitr::include_graphics("content/image/venn_diagram.jpeg")
```

```{r relationship, echo=FALSE , fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = " Figure 3: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.[@KOTU20191]"}

```

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, which is, in turn, a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI).

The central goal of AI is to provide a set of algorithms and techniques that can be used to solve problems that humans perform *intuitively* and near *automatically*. A great example of such a class of AI problems is interpreting and understanding the contents of an image -- this task is something that a human can do with little-to-no effort, but it has proven to be extremely difficult for machines to accomplish.

Machine learning is subfield tends to be specifically interested in ***pattern recognition*** and ***learning from data***.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a class of machine learning algorithms that learn from data and specialize in pattern recognition, inspired by the structure and function of the brain.

Deep learning is an approach to AI. It is a type of machine learning, a technique that allows computer systems to improve with experience and data.

## Data Scientist vs Machine Learning Engineer

```{r gpu-domain, echo=FALSE , fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = " Figure 4: domain area of deep learning[@Prabhu]"}
knitr::include_graphics("content/image/ml_ops.png")
```

MLOps is the process of automating and productionalizing machine learning applications and workflows.

In a perfect world, data scientist will do ML modelling while ML Engineer will productize ML model from Data Scientist.

## Reality: ML in production

```{r tec-dep, echo=FALSE , fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = " Figure 6:  Only a small fraction of real-world ML systems is composed of the ML code, as shown by the small black box in the middle. The required surrounding infrastructure is vast and complex.[@NIPS2015_86df7dcf]"}

```

Machine learning in production is very complicated! In reality (especially in Small & Medium Enterprise), Data Scientist & ML Engineer jobscrope is intertwine.
