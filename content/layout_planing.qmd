## What is Data Science?

- data scientist is someone who knows more statistics than a computer scientist and more computer science than a statistician ?

- a data scientist is someone who extracts insights from messy data. Todayâ€™s world is full of people trying to turn data into insight

### Breakdown

Inference

- basic of probability theory
- hypothesis testing
- significance test
- randomization inference
- power and confidence
- bayesian inference

Machine Learning

- regression
- regularization
- recommender system
- classification
- unsupervised learning
- neural networks
