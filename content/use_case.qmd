# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach that is s defined by its use of **_labeled datasets_**. These datasets are designed to train or “supervise” algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time.

# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms **_discover hidden patterns_** in data without the need for human intervention
