# About Learning II

## The "problem setting" of statistical learning.

The basic setting of statistical learning is: given a **problem statement**, we want to find **prediction model** which **estimate** has **best fit** in providing **solutions** to the problem, using **data at hand** (in sample data) which has the **Lowest Variance and Lowest Bias** when applied to the data at hand as well as to the **data not in hand** (unseen data).

## **Error and Bias**

The objective of "learning" is to simultaneously:

-   Achieve LOW variance of Estimator
-   Achieve LOW Bias of Estimator

### Case 1: High Variance and High Bias

![High Variance and High Bias](image/bias_case_1.png){#fig-bias-case1}

We have a poor estimator. Poor fit and poor predictor for **training sample** as well as for **test sample**.

### Case 2: High Variance and Low Bias

![High Variance and Low Bias](image/bias_case_2.png){#fig-bias-case2}

We have a low "precision" predictor. In another word, we have an **over-fitting**, and hence the precision is poor.

**Overfitting**: too much reliance on the training data

### Case 3: Low Variance and High Bias

![Low Variance and High Bias](image/bias_case_3.png){#fig-bias-case3}

We have precise predictor, but will work well only for **training sample**, however will be problematic when applied to cases **test sample**. This is the case of **underfitting**.

**Underfitting**: a failure to learn the relationships in the data

### Case 4: Low Variance and Low Bias

![Low Variance and Low Bias](image/bias_case_4.png){#fig-bias-case4}

The predictor will have a ***good fit*** for both **training sample** and **test sample**. This is what we want.

## Trade off

Base on our earlier objective:
